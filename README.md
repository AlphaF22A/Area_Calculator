# Basic C# Area Calculator

My second C# mini-project, using knowledge from my first mini-project. This allows you to calculate area of basic shapes via a command line program.

To run this program:

Download the entire repository, and launch command prompt (or Powershell) in the folder. Enter 'dotnet run console' to run the program

Alternatively, after downloading the repository, go to bin/Debug/net5.0, then launch Area_Calculator.exe
